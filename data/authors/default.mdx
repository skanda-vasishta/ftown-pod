## Who We Are:
Three soulless Kings fans from the boring suburbs of Folsom, CA decided to subject the outside world to their outrageous, delusional sports takes, birthing the F-Town Pod.

## Andrew Zimny

Once a prolific long-distance runner, Andrew now gets his heart rate up watching Demar Derozan and Zach Lavine take turns ballhogging in the clutch.

## Don To

The name Don To once struck fear in the hearts of his rec basketball opponents, but his competitive spirit has been reduced to yelling at the TV whenever Domantas Sabonis misses a layup. 

## Skanda Vasishta

Standing at a minuscule 5'6, Skanda was forced to enjoy basketball vicariously through his favorite players; now, his descent into madness is rapid, one Keegan Murray lost ball at a time.
