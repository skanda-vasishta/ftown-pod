## Open Letter to the Sacramento Kings
I used to consider myself lucky to live near my favorite NBA team. Lucky to be so deeply invested in a team that I loved. Lucky to look forward to a day where my team would lift the Larry O’Brien Trophy. Despite the clueless coaches, the mercurial management, the incompetent ownership, I remained hopeful—free of delusion—that one day, my team would soar to great heights. These past two seasons were as frustrating as the fifteen seasons that preceded them: no passion, no direction, no intent. Yet, whilst confined to the purgatorial trenches of Sacramento Kings basketball, I saw a glimmer. A ray of hope, perhaps. The ghosts of Cousins and Evans seemed miniscule in comparison to what lay at our door. This team was different, I felt it. This team, sparing the occasional defector, possessed the talent—lacking in past rosters—to play winning basketball. Nothing was set in stone, as nothing tends to be in our fickle lives. Yet, for the first time since Chris Webber himself made the Arco Arena his own, a foundation lay. A foundation filled with talent, effort, determination, and most importantly, an unquenchable desire to win. 
That foundation was eviscerated this morning. Desperation, perhaps, misled our management into leveraging our future. Our hopes, our future, our leader, our MVP, our Tyrese, gone. That glimmer, that hope, that chance, gone. Devastated would be an understatement. To have our optimism snatched from us so ruthlessly is a cruel reminder of the Kings’ incompetency. There is nothing to look forward to. No horizons to watch. Cursed are we as Kings fans, lodged between the jaws of inadequacy. To call our confinement to this franchise purgatory does not provide justice to our perils. We are trapped in Basketball Hell, with no feasible outlet of escape. Hence, I cannot in good faith continue as a fan of this franchise. This pathetic team has not only soured my relationship with them, but also with the NBA as a whole. To persist as a supporter in these hellish times would be to face death itself. For the sake of my mental health and my love for basketball, I shall support this team no more. This decision comes with a heavy heart, but I hope that one day—in the distant future—I can rekindle my love for this team. 

God Bless the Sacramento Kings,
Skanda Vasishta, former fan
